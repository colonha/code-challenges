# code-challenges

This repo will store coding challenges I will be solving over time. Please use it with caution since, some solutions could not be fully optimized. 

## 1. [FizzBuzz](code/fizzbuzz.py)
Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## 2. [Palindrome Detector](code/palindrome.py)
Create a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. Your program should ask for a word to check if whether it is a palindrome or not.
